### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Iancic, and I am a passionate programmer and game development student who has been working on indie projects since 2021. Along the years I acquired knowledge of C# and C++ and in field experience in Unity Engine. Recently I started taking interest in OpenGL, and 3D graphics. I am eager to learn about what itâ€™s like to work in the industry and hone my skills overall. 

Internally, I crave learning and improvement, whether it being a new programming principle, design skills or soft skill, I get motivated when I work around my weaknesses and potential. Setting goals, working under pressure, following my curiosity and hackathons motivate me the most in game development. The external motivation is the strongest for me, I love the feeling of seeing other gamers have fun with my own work.

âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working on Luminal Fear
