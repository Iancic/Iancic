### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Iancic, and I am a passionate programmer and game development student who has been working on game projects since 2021. Recently I started taking interest in OpenGL, and other 3D graphics. I am eager to learn about what itâ€™s like to work in the industry and hone my skills overall.
