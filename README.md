### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David, and I'm a 12th-grade student at William Shakespeare Timisoara who spends his free time developing and prototyping video games using C++ and C# in the Unity Engine. Internally, I crave learning and improvement, whether it being a new programming principle, design skills or soft skill, I get motivated when I work around my weaknesses and potential. Setting goals, working under pressure, following my curiosity and hackathons motivate me the most in game development. The external motivation is the strongest for me, I love the feeling of seeing other gamers have fun with my own work.

âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working on Luminal Fear
